##This app is far from complete. Here are things to be implented still:

-ability for user to create a comparison using drop downs instead of typing a sql query

-ability for user saved queries to persist per user, not for all users.

-ability to search all tables, not just teams

-data visualizations for returned results using D3

-hit google news for topical items regarding what the user has queried for

-styling
